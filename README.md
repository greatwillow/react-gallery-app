# Bella Galleria

## Overview

This is a simple app show-casing a searchable Gallery of photos as found through a free stock photo provider called Pexels. See [here](https://www.pexels.com/) to go to their website or [here](https://github.com/cravindra/pexels-api-wrapper) to browse their API documentation.

The app is constructed using a simple Express.JS server on the backend with a React.JS front-end using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a boilerplate starter kit.

## Live Version

The app is currently hosted on Heroku and can be seen [here](https://floating-reef-92429.herokuapp.com/). Note that if that site has not been actively engaged with for a period of over one hour, the initial load of the site will take longer since the site is considered dormant on Heroku's servers at that time.

## Installation and Usage

Here are some steps to get the app running locally.

- `git clone`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Navigate to localhost:3000
